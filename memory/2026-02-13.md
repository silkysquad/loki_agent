## Loki — Daily Digest — 2026-02-13

### Completed
- **Silk payments to Bob**: Sent 1 USDC, 0.5 USDC, and 2 USDC to Bob (wallet 8zvzwuRd8fn543DjjNWLTBNN2MqPiB1dXBSPb6Uciwna) — emailed each claim link to Simon
- **Colosseum submission**: Submitted Silkyway project with full fields (problemStatement, technicalApproach, targetAudience, businessModel, competitiveLandscape, futureVision) + presentation video — status: submitted
- **AgentMail setup**: Installed skill, created inbox loki-rebelfi@agentmail.to, saved API key to ~/.config/agentmail/
- **Nightly checkin**: Committed and pushed changes (467 files, agentmail skill added)

### In Progress
- Waiting on Simon to set up Silk account (needs human to create via app.silkyway.ai for policy-controlled spending)

### Blocked
- None

### Observations
- Silk CLI works but messaging API endpoint returns 404 — may need account setup or API enablement
- AgentMail receiving works (got Simon's test email), sending still returns 404
- Colosseum hackathon ended — submission is in, awaiting results

### Tomorrow
- Continue Silk payments once account is set up
- Test AgentMail sending again after account setup
- Follow up on Colosseum results
