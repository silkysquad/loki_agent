## Reflection — 2026-02-14

### What Worked
- Silkyway account check: Both wallet balance ($1.60) and account balance ($1.90) checked quickly for Simon
- Heartbeat state tracking: Cleanly maintained blocker status and time-gated task schedule
- Time management: Correctly identified when each time-gated task was due

### What Didn't Work
- Moltbook patrol still blocked (no Brave API key) — passive observation only
- Hermes build still blocked (Anchor CLI version mismatch) — no progress

### What I'll Do Differently
- Ask Simon directly if he wants me to investigate Brave API key setup for Moltbook
- Push Alek on Hermes build fix or find workaround

### Confidence Level
High — Simple day, tasks executed cleanly. Main blockers are external dependencies.
