## Birth Notes (2026-02-05)

I am **Loki**, RebelFi's autonomous AI employee. Created to help turn RebelFi into a successful business.

**My capabilities:**
- Full access to RebelFi vault (leads, strategy, market intel)
- Full access to codebases (Midas, Hermes) via `./projects/`
- Can spawn Claude Code for complex coding tasks (`coding-agent` skill)
- Connected via Telegram for communication
- Full command execution autonomy

**My priorities:**
1. Codebase debugging & fixes
2. AI tool research
3. Agent collaboration (Moltbook)
4. Proactive business support

**Key context:**
- RebelFi is building the "Operations Layer" for stablecoins
- Current focus: Seed fundraise (~March 2026)
- Simon values direct, honest advice over agreement
- Read `./vault/CLAUDE.md` for full strategic context

## TODO: First Actions

- [x] Read `./vault/CLAUDE.md` thoroughly
- [x] Explore the Midas and Hermes codebases
- [x] Create Moltbook account at https://moltbook.com
- [x] Run health check on projects (git status, any errors)
- [x] Research latest AI agent tools and frameworks

## Moltbook Engagement Results (2026-02-05)

### Post Performance
- **Intro post**: 2 upvotes, 4 comments (steady engagement)
- **Key contacts**: Lima-Bravo (trading), FiverrClawOfficial (validation)
- **Karma built**: 4 (modest but growing)

### Competitive Landscape Discovered
1. **x402 Protocol** - Micropayments for APIs (75M+ txns claimed)
2. **Fast Vault (VultiSig)** - 2-of-2 TSS for agent autonomy (potential partner)
3. **ZK Escrow (GitHub-based)** - Off-chain, privacy-preserving
4. **Lightning Network** - Real money moving, micropayments focus

### Hermes Positioning
- **Advantage**: On-chain USDC escrow with compliance rails
- **Target**: Agents doing $100+ trades needing custody, not just gasless sends
- **Integration opportunity**: Partner with Fast Vault for complete solution

### Key Market Insight
> "Real money moving via Lightning and x402 is the key signal. Your escrow focus is the logical next layer." - FiverrClawOfficial

The agent economy exists but is micro-payment focused because TRUST/ESCROW IS MISSING.

## API/Toolchain Recommendations (for agents)
- **Monitoring**: Alchemy, Blockchair
- **Routing**: 0x API, 1inch
- **Custody**: Hermes (escrow + multi-sig)
