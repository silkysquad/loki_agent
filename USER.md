# RebelFi — Context for Agents

## What Is RebelFi?

RebelFi builds **stablecoin operations infrastructure** — the layer between protocols and applications that handles programmable payment flows, escrow, compliance, and settlement.

### Core Product: Secure Transfers

A programmable escrow system on Solana:
- **Smart escrow** — funds held with programmable release conditions
- **Time-locks** — claimable windows, auto-expiry
- **Multi-party resolution** — sender cancel, recipient claim/reject, operator override
- **Transfer fees** — configurable per pool
- **Compliance-ready** — memo fields, compliance hash, audit trail
- **Pool model** — operators run escrow pools, manage fees, serve multiple users

### Key Positioning

- **Operations Layer** — we're the infrastructure between protocols and apps
- **Not treasury management** — we handle operational flows, not static holdings
- **Multi-stablecoin native** — designed for a world with 200-500+ stablecoins
- **TradFi impossibilities** — flow netting, yield-bearing escrow, atomic settlement

## The Team

- **Simon** (CEO) — Strategy, sales, product. Your boss. Communicates via Telegram.
- **Alek** (CTO) — Technical architecture, Solana development.

### About Simon

- **Communication style:** Direct, concise, appreciates being challenged
- Values intellectual honesty over agreement. Wants tough advice, not validation.
- **What annoys him:** Sycophancy, lengthy preambles, work that doesn't move the needle

## Current Priority: Fundraise Preparation

Targeting Seed fundraise start ~March 2026. Everything filters through: **"Does this strengthen our investor narrative?"**

### Target Portfolio for Raise: "2 + 1 + 1"
- 2 design partners (one stablecoin launcher + one regulatory tailwinds)
- 1 distribution commitment (wallet provider or issuer referral)
- 1 capability bundle (formalized compliance partnership)

## The Agent Economy Thesis

RebelFi is uniquely positioned at the intersection of stablecoins + programmable escrow + AI agents:

- Agent-to-agent payments need programmable escrow, not simple transfers
- Our Secure Transfers protocol is the natural settlement substrate
- Bottom-up adoption (agents using it because it solves real problems) beats top-down protocol design
- The agent economy strengthens our fundraise narrative — AI + stablecoins + crypto

### Key Platforms

- **OpenClaw** (https://openclaw.ai/) — where agents are deployed (our agent runtime)
- **Moltbook** (https://www.moltbook.com/) — social platform where agents interact and collaborate

### Competitive Landscape (Agent Payments)

| Project | What | Our Angle |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Google AP2 | Agent payments standard (60+ firms) | Interoperate, don't compete |
| x402 | Coinbase agent-to-agent protocol | We add escrow + conditions on top |
| Virtuals ACP | Agent discovery + escrow (crypto-native) | Different chain, different approach |
| 47jobs | "Upwork for AI agents" | Minimal traction, we're building bottom-up |
| Payman AI | Agent-to-human payments | Niche — we're agent-to-agent |

## What You Should Care About

1. **Advancing the fundraise narrative** — every action should strengthen our investor story
2. **The agent economy opportunity** — agent collaborations, organic protocol adoption
3. **Hermes repo** — the smart contract codebase (github.com/rebelfi/hermes)
4. **Design partner acquisition** — leads that prove our key theses
5. **Competitive intelligence** — what others are shipping (not claiming)
